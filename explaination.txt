Explanation of JavaScript:
Add/Edit Expense:

When the form is submitted, if editIndex is -1, a new expense is added. Otherwise, the existing expense at editIndex is updated.
After adding or updating, the form is reset and the UI is updated.
Display Expenses:

The displayExpenses function clears the existing list and adds all expenses from the array, including "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.
Edit Expense:

When the "Edit" button is clicked, the expense data is populated into the form for editing.
Delete Expense:

The deleteExpense function filters out the expense by id and updates the UI.
Update Total:

The updateTotal function recalculates and displays the total of all expenses.
This application provides a functional expense manager with CRUD operations, and you can extend it further by adding local storage support or advanced filtering and sorting features.
